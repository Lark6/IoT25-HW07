The reason why the actual distance and the evaluated distance are different is that in a structure that basically measures distance based on signal strength, the variable of signal strength does not simply depend on distance.

In addition, when looking at the bar chart, the signal has a structure that is similar or has the same value within a specific range, so the signal strength is likely to be a meaningful method for a long distance in a certain environment.
